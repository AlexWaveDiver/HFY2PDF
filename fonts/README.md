Designer: Sorkin Type

Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens.
Merriweather is an evolving project and will be updated. As of now there are 4 styles: Regular, Light, Bold, and Black. There are now Italic styles in each of these weights, too.
There is also Merriweather Sans, a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this serif family.
Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.
Merriweather is a work in progress and will be improved regularly. This means you can request improvements and even fund specific features if if they are outside of the current scope of work.
